# Development documentation (Third Iteration)

## ESLint

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is
similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

-   ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
-   ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
-   ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

### Installation and Usage

#### Command-line

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^8.10.0`, `^10.13.0`, or `>=11.10.1`), npm version 3+.

You can install ESLint using npm:

```
$ npm install eslint --save-dev
```

You should then set up a configuration file:

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

````
$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint yourfile.js

After running `eslint --init`, you'll have a `.eslintrc` file in your directory. In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
````

The names `"semi"` and `"quotes"` are the names of rules in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and
can be one of these values:

-   `"off"` or `0` - turn the rule off
-   `"warn"` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
-   `"error"` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and
details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)).

#### Integrations with code editors

With ESLint properly configured in your editor, your development experience can be careful. itâ€™ll help you produce
better quality code and teach you as you work.

code.
